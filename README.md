# Task Tracker

## Description 
Task Tracker helps users stay on top of their commitments using an interactive list of tasks. Each task must include a description, and has optional fields for the date and time. Double-clicking on a task marks the task as important, which is shown by a partial yellow border. Upon completion, a task can be removed by clicking the x.

To create a new task, press the 'Add' button in the top left corner. This opens up a form where you can fill in the details of your task. Once saved, the task will instantly appear in your list.
